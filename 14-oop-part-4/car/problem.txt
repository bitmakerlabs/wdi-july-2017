- Initialize a car with:
  - License plate number
  - Owner's name

- Goals:
  - A car can be started (turn ignition on)
  - A car can be stopped (turn ignition off)
  - A car can drive a given number of kilometres
  - A car can report its kilometrage
  - A car can crash, by itself, or with another car
  - Total number of cars should be kept track of
  - Total kilometres driven by all cars in existence should be kept track of

- Questions to ask yourself:
  - What kind of state (i.e. instance and class variables) do you need?
  - Exactly when can a car be driven?
