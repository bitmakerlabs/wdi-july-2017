- As a user, when an attribute is entered, I am prompted to type 'yes' or 'no' to confirm my selection.

- As a user, if 'yes' is typed, I am prompted to change 'id', 'firstname', 'lastname' and 'email'.

- As a user, when an attribute is entered, I am prompted to enter a new value for the attribute.

- As a user, if 'no' is typed, I am returned back to the main menu.

- As a user, if 'display all' is typed, I am shown all of the contacts that exist.
