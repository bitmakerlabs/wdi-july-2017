# Intro to Rails

Today we take a first look at Rails.

We will seek to understand the 10,000 feet view of the architecture of Rails, the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, and how Rails implements the basic web development core concepts that we have learned over the last couple of weeks.

We will also recreate the CRM in Rails as a simple demo of the power of Rails.
