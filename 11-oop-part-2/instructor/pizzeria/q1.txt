Write a Pizza class

- Initialize a pizza with a list of toppings.
  - To keep it simpler, disregard the dough type that we talked about yesterday.

- The behaviours of a pizza are:
  - bake
  - cut
    - Note that a maximum of *3* cuts can be performed.
	  - (Question to ask yourself: Can an uncooked pizza be cut?)
  - eat
    - (Question to ask yourself: Can an uncut pizza be eaten?)

- Think about what kind of attributes (i.e. state) that you will need to implement these behaviours
