# Drill:

1. Create a nav menu, it should have at least 4 links (Ex. Home, About, Archived, Contact)
2. Design the menu items mobile-first, they should stack under one another like so:

---------------------

Home  
About  
Archived  
Contact  

---------------------

3. Add a media query, when the minimum width of the browser is 500px wide, the links should align two-up.

---------------------

Home       About  
Archived   Contact

---------------------

4. Add another media query, when the minimum width of the browser is 720px wide, the links should align next to each other.

---------------------

Home       About     Archived     Contact

---------------------

5. Change the background colour of the body. Set your own break points (at minimum 3).

6. Create a new stylesheet called "responsive.css" and move all your media queries into that stylesheet.
   Don't forget to link to the new stylesheet! ;)
