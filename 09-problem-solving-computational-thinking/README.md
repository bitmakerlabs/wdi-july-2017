# Problem Solving and Computational Thinking

So far we've talk about how the fundamental build blocks of programming work, including variables, arrays, hashes, iteration, if/else statements, methods, arguments, and return values. But knowing the what and how isn't the hard part - the hard part is knowing why and when to apply each of these concepts when you're presented with any given programming task.

## Agenda
* What is computational thinking
  * decomposition
  * pattern matching
  * abstraction
  * algorithms

* Problem solving thought process
