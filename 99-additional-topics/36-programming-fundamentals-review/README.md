Today we'll do a review of some of the essential programming fundamentals we've been using over the program to ensure that you're ready to tackle your final project and upcoming interviews.

## Agenda

1. What is Ruby? Fundamentals review. (slideshow) - 50 minutes
  * Basic data types
  * Loops/Iteration
  * Methods
  * Hashes
  * Blocks
  * Object-oriented Programming (OOP)

1. Let's go abstract: can you read these lines of Ruby? (same slideshow) - 15 minutes, skip some if needed

1. Break - 5-10 minutes

1. Coding in another language - 30 minutes
  * Let's write some code in another language (eg. Python). Can we still read it and reason about it?
  * Do the Player exercise (ie. from https://alexa.bitmaker.co/cohorts/67/assignments/2025)
  * Add a simple game loop and accept user input
  * Use an array of monsters (hashes) to fight

1. Wrap-up - 5-10 minutes
  * Ruby fundamentals for Rails (back to slideshow)
  * Should be able to read code with `redirect_to`, `render`, etc.
  * Even if you don't know what's going on, you need to be able to identify that!
  * Ideally you can point out what is a method, what is a key in a hash, etc. etc.
